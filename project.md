## Introduction

Our chosen Texas city pair is Abilene to Houston. 

This new direct route will be operated by Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines sees the potential growth in this route because Abilene has a mix of business (agriculture, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing) and leisure (universities and smaller cities to travel). Abilene is an easier connection for central Texas. Instead of driving 3 hours to DFW and dealing with chaos to fly, they can drive to Abilene airport, fly to Houston, and then connect to anywhere. This service route is not about tourist demand but a steady and reliable traffic that feeds to a major hub.

**Five Questions:** 

1. What is the underlying O&D demand ABI–HOU/IAH?
2. How reliable would the direct flight be for customers? 
3. How profitable is the direct flight considering the plausible fare price and load factors? 
4. What does the demand for direct flights look like over time, and how would it likely evolve?
5. Given all of the factors, how much demand should Southwest expect if the direct flight were launched?
